# The Data-Science-Show-Coding-Sessions

This repo is to demonstrate how to carry out data science in real-life situation. Data Science follows a certain lifecycle depending on the types of projects. Through the coding session, we would like to demonstration the many different lifecycles. 

## Session 1: Data Science in E-Commerce (Retail) 
There is an abundance of AI based projects that one could think of in e-commerce. Imagine a food based retailer, one of the major issue that a retailer usually faces is with the supply chain. Groceries are short-lived products. If a retailer under stocks, this will mean that they are at the risk of losing customers, but if they overstock, they are wasting money on excessive storage in addition to waste. We could leverage AI to help retailer better stock the products that they sell.
